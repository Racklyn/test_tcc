        "text": "Copied post from Reddit, updated 15 Ultra camera bugs and issues:# Bugs# Exposure Presets Do Not Work with RAW* **Issue:** The saved exposure presets **always switch** the image format **to JPG**, even if RAW was previously selected.* **Expected Behavior:** Presets should either store the selected image format or ignore it (keeping RAW if it was active before).# Switching Cameras in 50MP RAW Mode Forces JPG* **Issue:** If you switch to a camera that does not support 50MP RAW, the system automatically switches to JPG. Even when switching back to the main camera, the setting remains JPG.* **Suggestion:** Add an option to prioritize either 50MP or RAW when changing cameras.# ISO Inconsistencies in Pro Mode (JPG vs. DNG)* **Issue:** When shooting in ProMode, if I set the ISO to a specific value (e.g., ISO 12.500), the JPG file reflects that ISO correctly. However, the corresponding DNG file is recorded at a significantly different ISO (e.g., ISO 6410). The JPG appears soft and muddy, whereas the DNG looks clear and preserves details.* **Expected Behavior:** Both JPG and DNG files should maintain the same ISO value to ensure consistent exposure and image quality. Since the JPG is essentially an extracted copy of the DNG, both files should exhibit the same level of detail.# ISO Inconsistencies in URAW Mode (JPG vs. DNG)* **Issue:** In URAW mode, a similar inconsistency is observed. For instance, with a value of ISO 8000 in the JPG, the corresponding DNG (URAW) is recorded at ISO 8317.* **Impact:** This mismatch results in the JPG displaying more highlight details, while the DNG (URAW) file fails to capture those details accurately—leading to highlights that are preserved in the JPG but burned out in the DNG.* **Expected Behavior:** The ISO values should match between the JPG and URAW DNG files so that the image quality and dynamic range remain consistent. It should not happen that the JPG preserves highlights better while they are lost in the DNG.It seems it's just not storing the higher ISO values correctly in the DNG.# Missing GPS Coordinates in DNG Files* **Issue:** When shooting in Pro Mode, GPS coordinates are stored in the JPG file but missing in the corresponding DNG file.* **Expected Behavior:** GPS data should be included in both file formats, as it is essential for geotagging and later image management.# Portrait Mode does not apply artificial bokeh when using the main camera* **Issue:** When using Portrait Mode with the main camera, no artificial bokeh is applied. It's not adjustable.* **Expected Behavior:** Portrait Mode should apply artificial background blur regardless of which camera is being used, just like it does with other sensors.# Photo Mode does not retain the last used camera/zoom level* **Issue:** When selecting a specific camera in Photo Mode and switching to another mode (e.g., Pro Mode, where the selected camera is retained), the camera choice is lost when returning to Photo Mode. Instead of keeping the previously used camera or zoom level, it always defaults to the main camera.* **Expected Behavior:** Photo Mode should remember the last used camera and zoom level so that users don’t have to manually reselect them after switching modes.Inconsistent Focal Length descriptionIssue: In Photo Mode, the HP9 sensor is used at a 4.1x magnification, corresponding to a focal length of about 96mm. In Pro Mode, however, it is labeled as 4.3x, which corresponds to approximately 100mm. Both modes produce images with the same field of view, meaning one of the labels is incorrect.Expected Behavior: The labels should be consistent and accurately reflect the true focal length.# Feature Requests# Enable 50MP RAW for the 100mm Telephoto Camera (or all cameras)* **Issue:** The 100mm telephoto camera does not support 50MP RAW, even though the HP9 sensor is capable of it.* **Suggestion:** Unlock the 50MP RAW option for all sensors, which would also prevent RAW settings from being lost when switching cameras.# Store Exposure Settings Per Camera Module* **Issue:** Currently, exposure settings apply globally to all cameras, even though different lenses require different optimal settings.* **Suggestion:** Allow individual exposure settings for each camera module. For example, wide-angle lenses often require different shutter speeds and exposure compensation than telephoto lenses.# Shutter Speed Limit Like in Professional Cameras* **Issue:** Currently, only fixed shutter speeds can be set, which can lead to overexposure in changing lighting conditions if the set speed is too long.* **Suggestion:** Add an optional **maximum shutter speed limit**, similar to professional cameras:* The camera can use **shorter** shutter speeds but not longer than the defined limit.* This prevents motion blur while still allowing automatic exposure adjustments in good lighting conditions.* **Example:** If the limit is set to **1/500s**, the camera can choose **1/500s or faster** but will never use a longer shutter speed, ensuring sharp images in action, sports, or moving subjects (kids, pets, etc.).# DNG+JPG Toggle for Photography KitProblem: When switching between camera modes, the RAW setting is often lost.**Suggestion:** Many useful functions can already be assigned to the video button, but there is currently no option to toggle between JPG, RAW, and URAW formats. Adding this feature would improve workflow efficiency.# Implementing these adjustments would significantly enhance the professional photography experience and further position Xiaomi as a true pro tool.",
